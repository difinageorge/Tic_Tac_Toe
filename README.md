# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game - Java GUI

This project was completed as part of my **Java Programming Internship** at **System Tron** (Week 02). The objective of this task was to create a **Java GUI-based Tic Tac Toe game** where a user plays against the computer. The application allows the player to choose their symbol (X or O) and alternates turns with the computer until there is a win or a draw.

## 🚀 Live Demo

This is a Java desktop application, so there is no online demo available.
You can download and run the code locally on your machine to try it out.

## 📌 Task Objective

Develop a **GUI-based Java Tic Tac Toe game** that:

* Allows the user to choose between playing as X or O.
* Automatically assigns the opposite symbol to the computer.
* Alternates turns between the user and computer.
* Detects win conditions and displays the result.
* Automatically resets the board after each game (win/draw).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java**

  * Swing (for GUI components)
  * AWT (for layout and font)
  * Random (for computer's move)
  * Event Handling (for button clicks and game logic)

## 🎮 Game Instructions

1. When the game launches, a dialog box prompts you to choose your symbol (X or O).

2. The game board appears as a 3x3 grid of buttons.

3. If the user goes first, click an empty cell to place your symbol.

4. The computer will automatically make its move.

5. The game continues turn-by-turn until:

   * A player wins (3 in a row, column, or diagonal).
   * All cells are filled, resulting in a draw.

6. A message is shown for **Win** or **Draw**, and the game automatically resets.

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable) or download the source code.

2. **Open the Project** in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).

3. **Compile and Run** the program.

   If using the terminal:

   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java
   java TicTacToe
   ```

4. The game window will launch with a symbol selection prompt. Enjoy playing!

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

* **Symbol Selection**: Choose between "X" or "O" before the game starts.
* **Automated Computer Moves**: The computer selects random empty cells.
* **Win Detection**: The game checks all rows, columns, and diagonals after each move.
* **Draw Detection**: Game ends in a draw if the board is full without a winner.
* **Auto Reset**: Game resets automatically after each round.

## 🔧 Future Scope

* Implement smarter AI (e.g., minimax algorithm) for the computer.
* Add score tracking (wins, losses, draws).
* Enhance UI with animations and design improvements.
* Add sound effects or background music.
* Provide a two-player mode.
